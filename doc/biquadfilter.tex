\chapter{SoLoud::BiquadResonantFilter}

The biquad resonant filter is a surprisingly cheap way to implement low and high pass filters, as well as some kind of band bass filter.

The implementation in SoLoud is based on "Using the Biquad Resonant Filter", Phil Burk, Game Programming Gems 3, p. 606.

The filter has three parameters - sample rate, cutoff frequency and resonance. These can also be adjusted on live streams, for instance to fade the low pass filter cutoff frequency for a outdoors/indoors transition effect.

The resonance parameter adjusts the sharpness (or bandwidth) of the cutoff.

\begin{lstlisting}{frame=single, framerule=1pt}
// Set up low-pass filter
gBQRFilter.setParams(SoLoud::BiquadResonantFilter::LOWPASS, 44100, 500, 2);  
// Set the filter as the second filter of the bus
gBus.setFilter(1, &gBQRFilter); 
\end{lstlisting}
