Codegen
=======

In order for SoLoud to be usable from other languages than C++,
glue code needs to be written. Most environments are able to
use "C" DLL:s, and this is one of the things SoLoud has.

Writing and maintaining glue code is, however, tedious and prone
to bugs, so the glue code for SoLoud is generated.

The "C" API is automatically generated from the c++ sources via the 
codegen tool that is part of the SoLoud sources. In most cases you
won't need to use the codegen yourself.

The codegen tool parses the SoLoud headers and generates the needed
headers and wrapper cpp code, as well as the DLL .def file, and a
Python file which can be used to generate glue libraries for other
environments, such as Python.
