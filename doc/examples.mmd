Examples
========

SoLoud package comes with a few simple examples. These can be found under the 'demos' directory. Pre-built binaries for Windows can also be found in the 'bin' directory.

simplest
--------

The simplest example initializes SoLoud, and uses the speech synthesizer to play some sound. Once the sound has finished, the application cleans up and quits.

This example also uses SoLoud's cross-platform thread library to sleep while waiting for the sound to end.

multimusic
----------

The multimusic example loads two OGG music loops as well as sound effects. You can use the keyboard keys 1 through 0 for various effects:

Key   Effect
----- --------
1     Play random sfxr "explosion" preset
2     Play random sfxr "blip" preset
3     Play random sfxr "coin" preset
4     Play random sfxr "hurt" preset
5     Play random sfxr "jump" preset
6     Play random sfxr "laser" preset
7     Fade music 1 in and music 2 out
8     Fade music 2 in and music 1 out
9     Fade music relative play speed way down
0     Fade music relative play speed to normal

piano
-----

This example is a simple implementation of a playable instrument. The example also includes a simple waveform generator (soloud_basicwave.cpp/h), which can produce square, saw, sine and triangle waves. If compiled to use portmidi, you can also use a midi keyboard to drive the example.

Key(s)   Effect
-------- --------
1234..   Play notes ("black keys")
qwer..   Play notes ("white keys")
asdf..   Select waveform
zxcv..   Selects filters. 
l        Lo-fi filter

Speech synthesizer and on-screen text describe what different keys do when pressed. Have fun experimenting!

mixbusses
---------

The mixbusses example demonstrates the use of mixing busses. You can use "qw", "as" and "zx" keys to adjust volume of different busses.

![Mix busses concept](images/mixbus)

In case of this example, only one "music" and one "sfx" is played, but the idea is still the same.

env
---

The env demo is a non-interactive demo of how SoLoud could be used to play environmental audio.

pewpew
------

The pewpew demo demonstrates the use of the playClocked commands.

Key  Effect
---- ------
1    Play sound repeatedly with playClocked()
2    Play sound repeatedly with play()
3    Play sound once with playClocked()

To exaggarate the effect a bit, the demo initializes SoLoud with a very large audio buffer. The difference between the play and playClocked
effects is that with play(), all sounds triggered between audio buffers begin playing from the start of the next audio buffer, while 
playClocked spreads the sounds across the audio buffer, making the sounds more separate.

space
-----

The space demo is a non-interactive demo showing visualization data captured from different parts of the audio pipeline. The
scope displays the data only from the speech synth while the FFT data only uses the music as input.
