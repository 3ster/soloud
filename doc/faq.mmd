Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What does it play?
------------------

Currently, SoLoud includes support for uncompressed 8 and 16 bit RIFF
Wav files, as well as Ogg Vorbis files. Both of these only support a
limited feature set of said formats, so you may experience some issues
with strange files.

Additionally, SoLoud comes with a speech synthesizer.

The interface for audio sources is relatively simple, so new formats and
noise generators, as well as audio filters, can be made.

An example sin/saw/triangle/square generator is also available, as part
of the "piano" example.

Since there are several liberally-licensed audio sources available, the
number of formats SoLoud will support is likely to grow in the future.

What dependencies does it have?
-------------------------------

There's no external library dependencies (apart from stdlib). However,
to get audio out of your speakers, a back-end is needed. Back-ends that
currently exist include SDL, windows multimedia and portaudio, and
SoLoud has been designed so that making new back-ends would be as
painless as possible.

Is there a DLL / C-Interface?
-----------------------------

Not yet. This has been requested though, so one may appear at some
point.

What's the animal in the logo?
------------------------------

A fennec fox. Google it. They're cute!

Is there a mailing list?
------------------------

There's a google group, at http://groups.google.com/d/forum/soloud

Main development occurs on GitHub, at
https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud and the issue tracker is in use.

Finally, there's \#soloud on ircnet, if you want to pop by.

Are these real questions?
-------------------------

Surprisingly, yes.
