SoLoud::FFTFilter
=================

The FFT filter is a simple voice-breaking filter that uses FFT and
inverse FFT. It's pretty much a broken filter and will most likely
get replaced in a future version of SoLoud.

The filter exists mainly to adjust the speech synthesizer's voice in
strange ways. It can also be used as basis for other FFT-based filters.

The filter does not support changing of parameters on the fly, nor does
it take changing of relative play speed into account.

There are three parameters, shift, combine and scale. Finding usable
results from the filter can be done mainly through trial and error. The
combine tells the filter how to combine the wet and dry signals - OVER
uses wet signal directly, SUBTRACT subtracts the wet signal from the
dry, and MULTIPLY multiplies them together.

Scale exists because the resulting volume level can be all over the
place.

    // Set up echo filter
    gFFTFilter.setParams(-15, FFTFilter::SUBTRACT, 0.002f);  
    // Set the filter as the first filter of the speech
    gSpeech.setFilter(0, &gFFTFilter); 

The first attribute (0) of the filter is the "wet" value, which can be
changed while the sound is playing.

FFTFilter.setParameters()
-------------------------

Set the parameters of the filter.

    gFFTFilter.setParams(-15, FFTFilter::SUBTRACT, 0.002f);
    
Changing the parameters does not affect "live" sounds. If invalid pameters are
given, the function will return error.
