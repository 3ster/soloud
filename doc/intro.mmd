Introduction
============

SoLoud is an easy to use, free, portable c/c++ audio engine for games.

How easy?
---------

The engine has been designed to make simple things easy, while not
making harder things impossible. Here's a code snippet that initializes
the library, loads a sample and plays it:

    // Declare some variables
    SoLoud::Soloud soloud; // Engine core
    SoLoud::Wav sample;    // One sample

    // Initialize SoLoud (with SDL)
    SoLoud::sdl_init(&soloud);

    sample.load("pew_pew.wav"); // Load a wave file
    soloud.play(sample);        // Play it

The primary form of use the interface is designed for is "fire and
forget" audio. In many games, most of the time you don't need to modify
a sound's parameters on the fly - you just find an event, like an
explosion, and trigger a sound effect. SoLoud handles the rest.

If you need to alter some aspect of the sound after the fact, the "play"
function returns a handle you can use. For example:

    int handle = soloud.play(sample);         // Play the sound
    soloud.setVolume(handle, 0.5f);           // Set volume; 1.0f is "normal"
    soloud.setPan(handle, -0.2f);             // Set pan; -1 is left, 1 is right
    soloud.setRelativePlaySpeed(handle, 0.9f);// Play a bit slower; 1.0f is normal

If the sound doesn't exist anymore (either it's ended or you've played
so many sounds at once it's channel has been taken over by some other
sound), the handle is still safe to use - it just doesn't do anything.

How free?
---------

SoLoud is released under the ZLib/LibPNG license. That means you can use
it in free or commercial applications as much as you want. You can
modify it. You don't need to give the changes back. You don't need to
release the source code. You don't need to add a splash screen. You
don't need to mention it in your printed manual.

Basically the only things the license forbids are suing me, or claiming
that you made SoLoud. If you redistribute the source code, the license
needs to be there. But not with the binaries.

Parts of the SoLoud package were not made by me, and those either have a
similar license, or more permissive (such as Unlicense, CC0, WTFPL or
Public Domain).

There's a Catch, Right?
-----------------------

SoLoud quite probably doesn't have all the features you'd find in a
commercial library like FMOD or WWISE. There's no artist tools or engine
integration. There's no 3d audio. Output is, currently, limited to
stereo.

It quite probably isn't as fast. As of this writing, it has no
specialized assembler optimizations, for any platform.

It certainly doesn't come with the support you get from a commercial
library.

If you're planning to make a multi-million budgeted console game, this
library is (probably) not for you. Feel free to try it though =)
