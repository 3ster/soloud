\chapter{SoLoud::Speech}

The SoLoud::Speech class implements a simple Klatt-style formant speech synthesizer. It's barely legible, not really human-like, but it's free, and it's here.

Adjusting the speech synthesizer's output with audio filters should allow for various voices, which, along with subtitles, will let you add voice to your games cheaply.

For more serious use, feel free to study the source code and play with the various internal parameters, as well as apply various filters to the sound.

For legal notes, please see the license page.

\section{Speech.setText()}

The setText function can be used to set the text to be spoken.

\begin{lstlisting}{frame=single, framerule=1pt}
SoLoud::Speech sp;
sp.setText("Hello world.  You will be assimilated.");
\end{lstlisting}

If the setText function is called while speech is playing, SoLoud stops any playing instances to avoid crashing.
