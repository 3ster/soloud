SoLoud::Wav
===========

The SoLoud::Wav class represents a wave sound effect. The source files
may be in 8 or 16 bit raw RIFF WAV files, or compressed Ogg Vorbis
files.

The sounds are loaded and converted to float samples, which means that
every second of a 44100hz stereo sound takes about 350kB of memory. The
good side is, after loading, these samples are very lightweight, as
their processing is mostly just a memory copy.

For lenghty samples like background music, you may want to use
SoLoud::WavStream instead.

Wav.load()
----------

The wav loader takes just one parameter, the file name:

    void load(const char *aFilename); // File to load

If loading fails, the sample will be silent.

    SoLoud::Wav boom;
    boom.load("boom.wav");

If the loading function is called while there are instances playing, the
result is undefined (most likely a crash).

Wav.loadMem()
-------------

Alternate way of loading samples is to read from a memory buffer.

    void loadMem(unsigned char *aMem, int aLength); // Sample to load

If loading fails, the sample will be silent.

    SoLoud::Wav boom;
    boom.loadMem(boomMemoryResource, boomMemoryResourceLength);

If the loading function is called while there are instances playing, the
result is undefined (most likely a crash).
