\chapter{SoLoud::Wav}

The SoLoud::Wav class represents a wave sound effect. The source files may be in 8 or 16 bit raw RIFF WAV files, or compressed Ogg Vorbis files.

The sounds are loaded and converted to float samples, which means that every second of a 44100hz stereo sound takes about 350kB of memory. The good side is, after loading, these samples are very lightweight, as their processing is mostly just a memory copy.

For lenghty samples like background music, you may want to use SoLoud::WavStream instead.

\section{Wav.load()}

The wav loader takes just one parameter, the file name:

\begin{lstlisting}{frame=single, framerule=1pt}
void load(const char *aFilename); // File to load
\end{lstlisting}

If loading fails, the sample will be silent.

\begin{lstlisting}{frame=single, framerule=1pt}
SoLoud::Wav boom;
boom.load("boom.wav");
\end{lstlisting}

If the loading function is called while there are instances playing, the result is undefined (most likely a crash).

\section{Wav.loadMem()}

Alternate way of loading samples is to read from a memory buffer.

\begin{lstlisting}{frame=single, framerule=1pt}
void loadMem(unsigned char *aMem, int aLength); // Sample to load
\end{lstlisting}

If loading fails, the sample will be silent.

\begin{lstlisting}{frame=single, framerule=1pt}
SoLoud::Wav boom;
boom.loadMem(boomMemoryResource, boomMemoryResourceLength);
\end{lstlisting}

If the loading function is called while there are instances playing, the result is undefined (most likely a crash).
