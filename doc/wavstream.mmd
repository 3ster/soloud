SoLoud::WavStream
=================

The SoLoud::WavStream class represents a wave sound effect that is
streamed off disk while it's playing. The source files may be in 8 or 16
bit raw RIFF WAV files, or compressed Ogg Vorbis files.

The sounds are loaded in pieces while they are playing, which takes more
processing power than playing samples from memory, but they require much
less memory.

For short or often used samples, you may want to use SoLoud::Wav
instead.

WavStream.load()
----------------

The wav loader takes just one parameter, the file name:

    result load(const char *aFilename); // File to load

If loading fails, the function will return an error code.

    SoLoud::WavStream muzak;
    muzak.load("elevator.ogg");

If the loading function is called while there are instances playing, the
result is undefined (most likely a crash).

WavStream.setLooping()
----------------------

This function can be used to set the wav stream to loop.

    soundtrack.setLooping(1);
    
Calling this function will not affect "live" sound sources.


WavStream.setFilter()
---------------------

As with any other audio source, you can attach filters to 
wav stream audio sources.

    gHipster.setFilter(0, &gLofi);

WavStream.stop()
----------------

You can stop all instances of a wav stream sound source with
stop(). This is equivalent of calling soloud.stopAudioSource()
with the sound source.

    gHammertime.stop();

WavStream.getLength()
---------------------

The length, in seconds, of this wav stream can be queried with this
function.

    double t = gRecord.getLength();
