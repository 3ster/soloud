SoLoud::WavStream
=================

The SoLoud::WavStream class represents a wave sound effect that is
streamed off disk while it's playing. The source files may be in 8 or 16
bit raw RIFF WAV files, or compressed Ogg Vorbis files.

The sounds are loaded in pieces while they are playing, which takes more
processing power than playing samples from memory, but they require much
less memory.

For short or often used samples, you may want to use SoLoud::Wav
instead.

WavStream.load()
----------------

The wav loader takes just one parameter, the file name:

    void load(const char *aFilename); // File to load

If loading fails, the sample will be silent.

    SoLoud::WavStream muzak;
    muzak.load("elevator.ogg");

If the loading function is called while there are instances playing, the
result is undefined (most likely a crash).
