\chapter{SoLoud::WavStream}

The SoLoud::WavStream class represents a wave sound effect that is streamed off disk while it's playing. The source files may be in 8 or 16 bit raw RIFF WAV files, or compressed Ogg Vorbis files.

The sounds are loaded in pieces while they are playing, which takes more processing power than playing samples from memory, but they require much less memory.

For short or often used samples, you may want to use SoLoud::Wav instead.

\section{WavStream.load()}

The wav loader takes just one parameter, the file name:

\begin{lstlisting}{frame=single, framerule=1pt}
void load(const char *aFilename); // File to load
\end{lstlisting}

If loading fails, the sample will be silent.

\begin{lstlisting}{frame=single, framerule=1pt}
SoLoud::WavStream muzak;
muzak.load("elevator.ogg");
\end{lstlisting}

If the loading function is called while there are instances playing, the result is undefined (most likely a crash).
